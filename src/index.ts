// TODO: remove this commented AJV require.
// We don't actually require AJV, but there is a bug with NPM and peer dependencies that is
// whose workaround is to depend on AJV.
// See https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/9691#issuecomment-367322703 for details.
// We need to add a require here to satisfy the dependency checker.
// require('ajv');
